    "Data Integration in Data Mining \n",
    "Last Updated : 01 Feb, 2023 \n",
    "•  •  \n",
    "INTRODUCTION : \n",
    "• Data integration in data mining refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources \n",
    "into a single, unified view. This can involve cleaning and transforming the data, as well as \n",
    "resolving any inconsistencies or conflicts that may exist between the different sources. The• Data Characterization: This refers to the summary of general characteristics or features of \n",
    "the class that is under the study. The output of the data characterization can be presented in \n",
    "various forms include pie charts, bar charts, curves, multidimensional data cubes. \n",
    "Example: To study the characteristics of software products with sales increased by 10% in \n",
    "the previous years. To summarize the characteristics of the customer who spend more than \n",
    "$5000 a year at AllElectronics, the result is general profile of those customers such as that they \n",
    "are 40-50 years old, employee and have excellent credit rating. \n",
    "• Data Discrimination: It compares common features of class which is under study. It is a \n",
    "comparison of the general features of the target class data objects against the general features \n",
    "of objects from one or multiple contrasting classes. \n",
    "Example: we may want to compare two groups of customers those who shop for computer \n",
    "products regular and those who rarely shop for such products(less than 3 times a year), the \n",
    "resulting description provides a general comparative profile of those customers, such as 80% of \n",
    "the customers who frequently purchased computer products are between 20 and 40 years old and \n",
    "have a university degree, and 60% of the customers who infrequently buys such products are \n",
    "either seniors or youth, and have no university degree. \n",
    "2. Mining Frequent Patterns, Associations, and Correlations: Frequent patterns are nothing \n",
    "but things that are found to be most common in the data. There are different kinds of frequencies \n",
    "that can be observed in the dataset. \n",
    "• Frequent item set: This applies to a number of items that can be seen together regularly for \n",
    "eg: milk and sugar. \n",
    "• Frequent Subsequence: This refers to the pattern series that often occurs regularly such as \n",
    "purchasing a phone followed by a back cover. \n",
    "• Frequent Substructure: It refers to the different kinds of data structures such as trees and \n",
    "graphs that may be combined with the itemset or subsequence. \n",
    "Association Analysis: The process involves uncovering the relationship between data and \n",
    "deciding the rules of the association. It is a way of discovering the relationship between various \n",
    "items. \n",
    "Example: Suppose we want to know which items are frequently purchased together. An example \n",
    "for such a rule mined from a transactional database is, \n",
    "buys (X, “computer”) ⇒ buys (X, “software”) [support = 1%, confidence = 50%], \n",
    "where X is a variable representing a customer. A confidence, or certainty, of 50% means that if a \n",
    "customer buys a computer, there is a 50% chance that she will buy software as well. A 1% \n",
    "support means that 1% of all the transactions under analysis show that computer and software are \n",
    "purchased together. This association rule involves a single attribute or predicate (i.e., buys) that \n",
    "repeats. Association rules that contain a single predicate are referred to as single-dimensional \n",
    "association rules. \n",
    "age (X, “20…29”) ∧ income (X, “40K..49K”) ⇒ buys (X, “laptop”) \n",
    "[support = 2%, confidence = 60%]. \n",
    "The rule says that 2% are 20 to 29 years old with an income of $40,000 to $49,000 and have \n",
    "purchased a laptop. There is a 60% probability that a customer in this age and income group will \n",
    "purchase a laptop. The association involving more than one attribute or predicate can be referred \n",
    "to as a multidimensional association rule. \n",
    "Typically, association rules are discarded as uninteresting if they do not satisfy both a minimum \n",
    "support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold. Additional analysis can be performed to \n",
    "uncover interesting statistical correlations between associated attribute–value pairs. \n",
    "Tasks and Functionalities of Data Mining \n",
    "•  •  \n",
    "Data Mining functions are used to define the trends or correlations contained in data mining \n",
    "activities. In comparison, data mining activities can be divided into 2 categories: \n",
    "1]Descriptive Data Mining:  \n",
    "This category of data mining is concerned with finding patterns and relationships in the data that \n",
    "can provide insight into the underlying structure of the data. Descriptive data mining is often \n",
    "used to summarize or explore the data, and it can be used to answer questions such as: What are \n",
    "the most common patterns or relationships in the data? Are there any clusters or groups of data \n",
    "points that share common characteristics? What are the outliers in the data, and what do they \n",
    "represent? \n",
    "Some common techniques used in descriptive data mining include: \n",
    "Cluster analysis:  \n",
    "This technique is used to identify groups of data points that share similar characteristics. \n",
    "Clustering can be used for segmentation, anomaly detection, and summarization. \n",
    "Association rule mining:  \n",
    "This technique is used to identify relationships between variables in the data. It can be used to \n",
    "discover co-occurring events or to identify patterns in transaction data. \n",
    "Visualization:  \n",
    "This technique is used to represent the data in a visual format that can help users to identify \n",
    "patterns or trends that may not be apparent in the raw data. \n",
    "2]Predictive Data Mining: This category of data mining is concerned with developing models \n",
    "that can predict future behavior or outcomes based on historical data. Predictive data mining is \n",
    "often used for classification or regression tasks, and it can be used to answer questions such as: \n",
    "What is the likelihood that a customer will churn? What is the expected revenue for a new \n",
    "product launch? What is the probability of a loan defaulting? \n",
    "Some common techniques used in predictive data mining include: \n",
    "Decision trees: This technique is used to create a model that can predict the value of a target \n",
    "variable based on the values of several input variables. Decision trees are often used for \n",
    "classification tasks. \n",
    "Neural networks: This technique is used to create a model that can learn to recognize patterns in \n",
    "the data. Neural networks are often used for image recognition, speech recognition, and natural \n",
    "language processing. \n",
    "Regression analysis: This technique is used to create a model that can predict the value of a \n",
    "target variable based on the values of several input variables. Regression analysis is often used \n",
    "for prediction tasks. \n",
    "Both descriptive and predictive data mining techniques are important for gaining insights \n",

    "patterns, while predictive data mining can be used to make predictions based on those patterns. \n",
    "Together, these techniques can help organizations to understand their data and make informed \n",
    "decisions based on that understanding. \n",
    "Data Mining Functionality:  \n",
    "1. Class/Concept Descriptions: Classes or definitions can be correlated with results. In \n",

      " Loose coupling refers to the integration of data at a low level, while tight coupling refers to the integration of data at a high level. Loose coupling involves integrating data from different sources in a way that makes it easy to change or replace one component without affecting the others, while tight coupling involves integrating data in a way that makes it difficult to change or replace one component without affecting the others. The choice between loose and tight coupling depends on the specific requirements of the application and the level of complexity involved.
